# Summary
I used to work as a sound mixer on television. After the war started I left Russia and now I am moving from country to country. I want to learn a new profession, programming is a great option for me because I can work remotely from anywhere in the world and I just only need a computer for my work. I also have 2 cats and I am super motivated to learn a new profession as soon as possible and start working soon to save my cats from the stress of moving and let them live in a civilized country in peace.

# Skills
I'm totally new to programming, I casually studied html & css on the internet and took a js&react course on [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript_full/) (10% completed), I remember almost nothing.

# CodeExample
`console.log("hello world");`

# Education

Master's Degree in Sound Production of Audio-visual Arts
